%SENDWPsTOFLIGHTGEAR Sends all waypoints to flightgear
%   Sends all waypoints in waypoint array to flightgear via the UDP stream u
%   that must be defined in the workspace. Waypoint are read from Xpoints, 
%   Ypoints, and Zpoints arrays which hold the latitude, longitude, and altitude
%   (in meters) of each each waypoint. wpCount must also be defined as the
%   number of waypoints to send.
