# SLUGS Autopilot 

SLUGS Autopilot embedded code base runs on board the vehicle to be controlled.
Currently, we use a duel microprocessor architecture, though that may change
in the future.

## Repository Layout

This repository contains the SIMULINK models that compile into code to be run
on each of SLUGS' microprocessors.  The *controlMCUSlugsMKIINewNav.mdl* model
holds the control DSC logic, and *sensorMCUSlugsMKII.mdl* for the sensor DSC.
The control DSC handles state estimation, navigation, and actuator control.
The sensor DSC reads and calibates vehicle sensors, and is also used for HIL
feedthrough during simulation.
 
Binaries and non-autogenerated state machine code can be found in
*controlMCUSlugsMKIINewNav_dspic/* and *sensorMCUSlugsMKII_dspic/*. Low-level
code related to the hardware is located in the *clib/* folder.
