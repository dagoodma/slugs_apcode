Calibration
We will use the precission bias null calibration. That requires the unit to be static for 30 seconds.
Address = 0x3E			//GLOB_CMD
Value   = 0x10
bits [6:7] of Address must be [1 0] since this will be a write
=> [1 0 1 1][1 1 1 0][0 0 0 1][0 0 0 0] X 
=> 0xBE10

we will also use the acceleration bias compensation and use the
DIO pin in the cube to let us know when data is ready

Definition of the Internal Sample Rate

Ts = Tb(Ns+1) , where
	 Ts is Sample Time (1/Fs)
	 Tb is time base, it is either 0.61035e-3 S or 18.921e-3 S
	 Ns is the multiplier, which is configured in register SMPL_PRD
	 
So desired Ts = 0.00125 (800Hz) then
	 0.00125 = 0.61035e-3 * (3.096 + 1)
	 => Choose multiplier as 1 => Ts = 1.22e-3 S => Fs= 819.2 Hz

So the register configuration is as follows:
Address = 0x36
Value   = 0x01
bits [6:7] of Address must be [1 0] since this will be a write
=> [1 0 1 1][0 1 1 0][0 0 0 0][0 0 0 1]
=> 0xB601

Digital Filtering and Dynamic Range

The dynamic range will be set to 300 deg/s and the taps at the minimum 4.
Since this configuration spans two registers it will be done in two steps,
by the data sheet recomendation, sensitivity first, then taps.

Address	= 0x39
Value	= 0x04
bits [6:7] of Address must be [1 0] since this will be a write
=> [1 0 1 1][1 0 0 1][0 0 0 0][0 1 0 0]
=> 0xB904

The taps will be set at the minimum of 4  (therefore the value is 2 since
they are powers of 2)
Address	= 0x38
